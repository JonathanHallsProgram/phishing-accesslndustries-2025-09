Subject: Phishing report – look-alike domain accesslndustries[.]com impersonating Access Industries

Hello Access Industries team,

I’m reporting a phishing/impersonation email that uses the look-alike domain accesslndustries[.]com (lowercase L instead of I) while claiming to be from “Access Industries” about a “Service Support Engineer” role. I confirmed by phone on 2025-09-04 that this is not legitimate.

I’ve attached the raw .eml with full headers for your investigation. Key details:
